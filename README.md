# MPLib
<p>A simple multi precision library for c++ I created in my spare time. Should currently not be used for serious projects as it is not yet fully
implemented and is slower than other multi precision libraries available for free (example: GMP).</p>
<p>If you want to help me implement this library or have a doubt about part of the  code feel free to contact me on my Skype "xloneify".</p>
